"""Unit card / unit info card rendering.

Ported from the v0.9.x toolkit's "Unit Cards" panel. Two things changed:

* Blender 5 dropped `Scene.node_tree` in favour of `Scene.compositing_node_group`,
  removed the Gamma and Mix RGB compositor nodes, turned the Filter node's
  `filter_type` into a menu socket, and - most importantly - the compositor output
  is now always the scene render resolution. The old setup rendered at 480x660,
  scaled the image to 10% with a Transform node and let an Alpha Over against a
  48x66 (fully transparent) reference image crop the canvas down to card size.
  The rescale half of that still works and is what the graph does: the render is
  a whole multiple of the card, the Transform takes it back to card size, and
  everything after it - the sharpen in particular - therefore acts at final card
  pixel size, which is the look the old .blend files have. The canvas half does
  not: Transform, Alpha Over and the Crop node all hand back an image the size of
  the render whatever they are fed, so the scaled-down card sits in the middle of
  a full-size transparent frame and the crop out of it is done in saveCard.
* Models and textures no longer have to be converted by hand. The card import
  reuses the same IWTE extraction the Unit Import workmode uses (unitChecker ->
  task file -> IWTE -> .glb + .dds), so pointing the toolkit at a mod is enough.

    left standing there is the one armature being carded. Nothing hidden is put
    back: a variation mesh, a shield or a helmet switched off by hand stays off,
    which is what the card wants - `hideVariations` hides the spare heads and
    weapons with the eye AND `hide_render`, and the default mode's "switch the
    unit back on" undoes exactly that. The camera and the light it carries are
    the only things ever forced on, without which the render is black. It is all
    put back before the next camera, the same as the default mode.

    `family` is what counts as "the unit" - cardFamily works it out from the
    isolation scope, so a mount can be kept whole or narrowed to the one
    armature of it being carded. Left out, it is the whole unit.

    Returns the state restoreVisibility puts back.
